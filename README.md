# CounterSwift

This app is designed to allow you to keep track of a count by incrementing it with the touch of a button start after every 1sec.

To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Download the Xcode IDE and open the project file in Xcode.

2. Build and run the project on a simulator.

3. Once the app is running, you will see a simple interface with a label that displays the current counter laber and three buttons labeled "start", "stop" and "reset".

4. To run the counter, tap the "start" button. To stopt the counter, tap the "stop" button.

5. The counter will update in real time, and the label will reflect the new value.

6.To reset the counter to zero, simply tap "reset" button.

That's it! This app is simple to use and can be helpful for keeping track of anything that requires a counter. Feel free to modify and customize it to suit your needs.
